URLify

String are one of the core data types in JavaScript, so understanding how to manipulate them is a vital skill for all front end developers. 
The string data type comes with many utility functions which we can use to find and replace characters. 

Let's create a function that takes in a blog post title and returns the URL-ified version. 
To create a URL friendly version of a blog post title:
-all punctuation must be removed
-all letters must be lowercase
-all spaces must be joined by hyphens. 

You should use a combination of regular expressions and string prototype functions to complete this challenge.
