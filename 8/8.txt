Dynamic colors

Closures are functions that close over their lexical environment or their scope. 
This allows us to access an outer function scope from an inner function. We use closures in many different places. 
For example, if we're filtering an array of items, or if we're creating a timeout. 

In this challenge, we'll use closures to create three buttons. 
Each button will represent a different color and we'll change the background color of the document body to the color value. 

Using a closure, create a function called changeColor that accepts a color value. 
When the button is clicked, the closure should be invoked and the body background color should be updated.
