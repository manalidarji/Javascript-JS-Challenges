De-structuring is an expression, which allows us to extract values from objects and arrays into variables. 
To destructure values from arrays, we use square brackets and to destructure values from objects, we use curly brackets. 

The first variable declared in the brackets will receive the first array item as its value. 
The second variable will receive the second array item as its value, and so on. 
You can use the spread operator or three dots to replace the remaining array or object values into one variable. 

For this challenge, you'll use array and object de-structuring to return a list of students. 

Create a function called 'getStudents', which takes one argument, 'classroom' which will contain a boolean value called 'hasTeachingAssistant' and class list, which is an array of people in the classroom. 

The first value in class lists will be the teacher. 
If has teaching assistant is true, The second value in the class list is the teaching assistant and the remaining values in the class list are the students. 

If has teaching assistant is false, The second value through the end of the class list are the students. 

Your job is to return a list of students. You must use object and array de-structuring.
