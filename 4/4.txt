In a first challenge we created a Book class that accepts a title, author, ISBN, and number of copies, and provides methods for selling and restocking. 

And this challenge we'll use inheritance to create a variation on our Book class. 

Your goal is to create a TechnicalBook class that inherits from the Book class in the previous challenge. 

This class will also take a title, author, ISBN, and number of copies, but will take a fifth argument, an edition. 

The TechnicalBook class will also provide a getEdition function which returns the following string. 
The current version of this book is, followed by the book's edition. You should use a template literal for this phrase.
